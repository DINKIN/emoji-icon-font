This is an experimental font. It's pretty much a proof of concept to illustrate the use of standardized UNICODE plains for icon fonts.

Most icons originate from Icomoon or Flatfont. Some originate from Wikimedia or the OpenSans font.

Icons typically are re-adjusted to be centered on a square grid.

The font contains a total of 650 glyphs.
